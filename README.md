# Summary
This was my first ever project containing forms for people to submit and error messages showing up when something wasn't completed! 
Had a lot of fun with this one, very grateful for my man at Codevault's videos helping me with the original issues I was experiencing with that.
As always have a great one, and see you in the next chapter!
